          <h2><u>WHAT IS SUCCESS??</u></h2>
          <p>Success is not just about achieving fame, wealth, or recognition—it’s about setting meaningful goals and steadily working toward them, no matter how small the steps may be. It begins with a vision and grows through dedication, discipline, and consistent effort. Every milestone, no matter how minor it seems, is a stepping stone toward something greater.
            </p>
            <p>Success is a personal journey, unique to each individual. It’s about finding fulfillment in what you do, nurturing your passions, and making a positive impact on the world around you. It’s not just about the destination; it’s about the growth and experiences gained along the way.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, success is a blend of hard work, resilience, and the courage to pursue your dreams. It’s about believing in yourself and your abilities, even when faced with challenges. Remember, success is not a one-time event; it’s a continuous journey of self-discovery and achievement.</p>
